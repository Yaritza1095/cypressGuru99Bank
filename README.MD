This project is based on Guru 99's Selenium Live Project: FREE Real Time Project for Practice

The project aims to put QA's in a simulated corporate test environment, the goal was tp automate using Selenium but I'll be translating the requeriments into Cypress
to automate the test cases for a demo banking website: https://www.demo.guru99.com/V4/. 

The project's duration is 7 days and QA gets an email every 24 hours with the work allocation for that day
